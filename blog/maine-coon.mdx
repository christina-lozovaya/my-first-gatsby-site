The **Maine Coon** is a large domesticated cat breed. It is one of the oldest natural breeds in North America. 
The breed originated in the U.S. state of Maine,[3] where it is the official state cat.

The Maine Coon is a large and social cat, which could be the reason why it has a reputation of being referred to as "the gentle giant." 
The Maine Coon is predominantly known for its size and dense coat of fur which helps the large feline to survive in the harsh climate of Maine, the state from which they originated. 
The Maine Coon is often cited as having "dog-like" characteristics.[5][6]

Due to the large size of this feline, professionals have noticed certain health problems arising in the breed, including feline hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and hip dysplasia.
