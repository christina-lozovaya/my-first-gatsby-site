The **Sphynx cat** also known as the Canadian Sphynx, is a breed of cat known for its lack of fur. 
Hairlessness in cats is a naturally occurring genetic mutation, and the Sphynx was developed through selective breeding of these animals, starting in the 1960s.

According to breed standards, the skin should have the texture of chamois leather, as it has fine hairs, or the cat may be completely hairless. 
Whiskers may be present, either whole or broken, or may be totally absent. The cats have a narrow, long head and webbed feet. 
Their skin is the color that their fur would be, and all the usual cat markings (solid, point, van, tabby, tortie, etc.) may be found on the Sphynx cat's skin. 
Because they have no fur, Sphynx cats lose body heat more readily than coated cats, making them both warm to the touch and prone to seeking out warm places.

## Breed standards
The breed standards are defined by The International Cat Association (TICA):

* Wedge-shaped heads with prominent cheekbones
* Large, lemon-shaped eyes
* Very large ears with hair on inside, but soft down on outside base
* Well-muscled, powerful neck of medium length
* Medium length torso, barrel-chested, and full, round abdomen, sometimes called a pot belly
* Paw pads thicker than other cats, giving the appearance of walking on cushions
* Whiplike, tapering tail from body to tip, (sometimes with fur all over tail or a puff of fur on the tip, like a lion)
* Muscular body
